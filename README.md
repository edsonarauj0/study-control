# Study Control

This is a minimal example of a study control application built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS and shadcn-inspired components.

## Development

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application stores tasks in `localStorage` so your data persists between page reloads.
